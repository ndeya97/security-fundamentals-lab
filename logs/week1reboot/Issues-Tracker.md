## 📋 Issues Table – Hybrid View

| 🧩 Internal ID | 🧠 GitHub Ref | 🎓 Title | 📅 Milestone | ⚙️ Status | 🔗 Links / Comments |
|:--:|:--:|:--|:--|:--:|:--|
| **#1** | [#5](https://github.com/ndeya97/security-fundamentals-lab/issues/5) | Coursera – Module 1 (*Foundations of Cybersecurity*) | Week-1 Reboot | 🟢 Completed (quiz pending FA) | All videos + resources done · notes committed |

## 🧠 Guidelines
- 🟢 **Completed** → task closed via commit (`closes #x`).  
- 🔁 **Carried Over** → moved to next milestone.  
- 🕓 **Pending** → awaiting external event (e.g., financial aid approval).

---

## 💬 Daily Use
1. Update *Status* and *Comments* each day.  
2. Add direct commit links (e.g., `closes #7`) to track GitHub progress.  
3. Sunday → copy your “Summary to GitHub” block into `WEEK-1_Reboot_SUMMARY.md`.  
4. Keep this tracker as the **baseline reference** for subsequent weeks.
