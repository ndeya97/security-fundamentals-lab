## 🇬🇧 4. English Reflection

> This week I learned that steady progress matters more than speed.
I practiced English through Coursera lessons and glossary writing.
Even with a short health break, I stayed engaged by reviewing my notes.
Next week, I will reinforce technical vocabulary and start writing short summaries in English.
